## scan_files.sh
The Linux script `scan_files.sh` scans all subdirectories of the repository folder and collects all file names. 

The output of the script `scan_files.sh` is HTML-file `index.html`. The header of the script contains some parameters, which define for which artile in wikiversity these open source files are created. E.g. an R-script for a Wikiversity Learning Resource `Diffusion` will be stored in the subdirectory `/Diffusion` of this repository.
